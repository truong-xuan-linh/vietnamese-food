In Vietnamese cuisine, it is called cơm cháy (literally "scorched rice"). It is typically fried in oil until golden brown, then topped with chà bông (pork floss) or tôm khô (dried shrimp), mỡ hành (chopped scallions cooked by pouring boiling oil over them to release their aroma), and chili paste to produce a popular dish called cơm cháy chà bông or cơm cháy tôm khô (although both the pork and shrimp may be used, in which case the dish is called cơm cháy chà bông tôm khô or cơm cháy tôm khô chà bông). Cơm cháy may be made from the crust of rice left over from cooking rice in an iron pot, or, more commonly since the advent of electric rice cookers in the late 20th century, from leftover rice that is fried in oil over high heat to acquire a crispy texture.

Don’t be scared because it’s totally delicious and comfort dish of Vietnamese people. I would like to introduce Vietnamese pork organ rice congee which turns pork innards and blood into hearty and healthy rice congee. One of the highlights of Vietnamese pork organ rice congee is the flavorful broth cooked from pork bone, meat and organs for a few hours. The rice is pan-toasted before being cooked in broth until the rice grain breaks down. The pork organs and meat must be tender and there will be an attractive smell. The organs and meat are removed from the pot and sliced. To serve, the congee is ladled into a bowl. Then congealed blood, slices of pork meat, liver, chunks of tubular innards, fried scallions, fried dough, chopped green onion are added. Chao long couldn’t be a lack of fried dough which will be softened and engorges as it soaks up the rice congee like a sponge. Bean sprouts, lime wedges and fish sauce are available tableside for you to season the congee. Some prefer bean sprouts being put into the bowl before the congee is ladled. It’s easy to find a stall serving Chao long in Vietnam.
